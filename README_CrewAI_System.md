- **Tools**: Web search and website scraping for venue research

### 2. Logistics Agent  
- **Role**: Master Logistics Coordinator
- **Goal**: Organize all logistical aspects including vendors, contracts, transportation, and scheduling
- **Backstory**: Backbone of successful event operations with strong background in vendor management, budget control, and deadline adherence
- **Memory**: Enabled for tracking vendor relationships, timelines, and past performance
- **Delegation**: Allowed (true) - can delegate tasks to other agents and coordinate resources
- **Tools**: Web search for vendor discovery and service comparison

### 3. Marketing Agent
- **Role**: Event Marketing & Promotion Lead  
- **Goal**: Develop comprehensive marketing strategy and campaigns to maximize attendance and engagement

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

### SerperDevTool
- **Purpose**: Web search capabilities for real-time information gathering
- **Relevance**: Enables agents to find current venue information, vendor details, and market trends
- **Usage**: Integrated into all three agent tasks for comprehensive research

### WebsiteSearchTool  
- **Purpose**: Web scraping and content extraction from specific websites
- **Relevance**: Allows agents to gather detailed information from venue websites, vendor pages, and industry resources
- **Usage**: Used by venue and logistics agents for detailed service analysis

## üß† Memory and Delegation Explanation

### Memory System
- **Venue & Logistics agents**: Have memory enabled to learn from previous interactions, build vendor relationships, and improve decision-making over time
- **Marketing agent**: No memory - focuses on current campaign without historical bias, ensuring fresh creative approach

### Delegation Strategy
- **Logistics agent**: Can delegate tasks to other agents (allow_delegation: true) - acts as coordinator for complex logistical operations
- **Venue & Marketing agents**: Work independently (allow_delegation: false) - maintain focus on specialized tasks without interference

## üöß Guardrails Implementation

Prevents AI hallucinations and ensures data accuracy by implementing strict validation rules for each task.

### Venue Booking Guardrails
- Always verify venue information from official sources
- Provide specific contact details and pricing when available
- Include source URLs for all research findings
- Cross-reference information from multiple sources
- Verify venue availability and booking policies

### Logistics Guardrails
- Verify vendor credentials and reviews from multiple sources
- Include specific pricing and contract terms when available
- Provide backup vendor options for critical services
- Check vendor insurance and liability coverage
- Verify vendor availability for event dates

### Marketing Guardrails
- Base marketing strategies on verified industry best practices
- Include specific social media platform recommendations
- Provide measurable success metrics and KPIs
- Verify target audience demographics and preferences
- Include budget allocation and ROI projections

## üìä Sample Output

## üöÄ System Architecture

### YAML Configuration
- **agents.yaml**: Defines agent roles, goals, backstories, and capabilities
- **tasks.yaml**: Specifies task descriptions, expected outputs, and guardrails
- **Modular design**: Easy to modify agent behaviors and task requirements

### Pydantic Models
- **TaskEstimate**: Structured task information with time and resource estimates
- **Milestone**: Project milestone definitions with associated tasks
- **EventPlan**: Complete event planning structure with tasks and milestones

### Crew Management
- **Sequential execution**: Tasks executed in logical order
- **Agent collaboration**: Information sharing between specialized agents
- **Result aggregation**: Structured output combining all agent contributions
